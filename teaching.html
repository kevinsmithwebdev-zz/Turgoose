			<p class="text-header">Philosophy of Teaching</p>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
				There are few things more personal than music.  As music educators, it
				is our job not only to inspire creativity through this art, but to impart
				musical knowledge and encourage expression and self-discovery.  This is
				no small task.  It is my belief that the student benefits the most from a
				teacher that never stops learning herself, and that elements such as environment,
				positive reinforcement, and appropriate feedback are crucial to the success of each
				child.  Experience has taught me that the best teachers are those who never
				stop working to improve their craft, and those who constantly seek new information
				and find different ways to incorporate their own musical and personal growth
				into their classrooms.  By improving teaching tactics, training in new technology,
				learning new instruments and improving upon studied ones, etc., teachers
				are furthering their own education and can therefore enrich the education
				they are giving to their students. Music education is a complex process
				in which students learn far more than simple facts and figures.  Through
				music, a child learns that dedication to practice, self-discipline, and
				teamwork can turn a great deal of individual voices into a single ensemble
				that is capable of far more than any student could achieve on their own.
				Participation in such ensembles also allows students to gain lessons in
				humility and responsibility, all while learning to make beautiful sounds
				of which they can be proud.
			</p>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
				Creating a safe, enthusiastic environment is crucial to instilling these
				important life lessons. Because music is so personal, students can be left
				feeling vulnerable, and it is important to constantly reinforce the idea
				that questions are welcome and mistakes are merely opportunities to learn.
				Positive reinforcement, encouragement, and corrective feedback go much further
				than negative, and the development of one’s character is as important as the
				development of one’s musical skill (I believe my teacher put it best when
				he said “Being a good person is just as important as being a good musician.”)
				I try my best to “practice what I preach” on that issue in particular, and
				strive to set an example for my students so that they leave my class not
				only as better musicians, but as better people.  I believe that teaching
				itself is a skill and an art.  Musicians spend a lifetime developing their
				instruments, and teaching is no different.  I like to think of teachers as
				jazz improvisers.  The fundamentals of music (scales, chords, etc.) are like
				the fundamentals of teaching (classroom management, teaching techniques,
				etc.) After years of musical study and countless hours of practice, a great
				improviser learns how to build a beautiful melody from that musical foundation.
				Teaching requires that same level of dedication and practice to successfully
				mold the human mind in all its vast and varying forms.  Improvisation is key
				to teaching a classroom of individual minds, as one method of learning for
				few students may not work for others, and it is only through commitment to
				perfecting this craft that this art form will truly take shape.
