			<p class="text-header">Philosophy of Teaching</p>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
				There are few things more personal than music.  As music educators, it is our job not only to inspire creativity through this art, but to impart musical knowledge and encourage expression and self-discovery.  This is no small task.  It is my belief that the student benefits the most from a teacher that never stops learning herself, and that elements such as environment, positive reinforcement, and appropriate feedback are crucial to the success of each child.
				Experience has taught me that the best teachers are those who never stop working to improve their craft, and those who constantly seek new information and find different ways to incorporate their own musical and personal growth into their classrooms.  By improving teaching tactics, training in new technology, learning new instruments and improving upon studied ones, etc., teachers are furthering their own education and can therefore enrich the education they are giving to their students. Music education is a complex process in which students learn far more than simple facts and figures.  Through music, a child learns that dedication to practice, self-discipline, and teamwork can turn a great deal of individual voices into a single ensemble that is capable of far more than any student could achieve on their own.  Participation in such ensembles also allows students to gain lessons in humility and responsibility, all while learning to make beautiful sounds of which they can be proud.

				Creating a safe, enthusiastic environment is crucial to instilling these important life lessons. Because music is so personal, students can be left feeling vulnerable, and it is important to constantly reinforce the idea that questions are welcome and mistakes are merely opportunities to learn.  Positive reinforcement, encouragement, and corrective feedback go much further than negative, and the development of one’s character is as important as the development of one’s musical skill (I believe my teacher put it best when he said “Being a good person is just as important as being a good musician.”).  I try my best to “practice what I preach” on that issue in particular, and strive to set an example for my students so that they leave my class not only as better musicians, but as better people.
				I believe that teaching itself is a skill and an art.  Musicians spend a lifetime developing their instruments, and teaching is no different.  I like to think of teachers as jazz improvisers.  The fundamentals of music (scales, chords, etc.) are like the fundamentals of teaching (classroom management, teaching techniques, etc.). After years of musical study and countless hours of practice, a great improviser learns how to build a beautiful melody from that musical foundation.  Teaching requires that same level of dedication and practice to successfully mold the human mind in all its vast and varying forms.  Improvisation is key to teaching a classroom of individual minds, as one method of learning for few students may not work for others, and it is only through commitment to perfecting this craft that this art form will truly take shape.

			<p class="text-header">Justification and Philosophy of Jazz Education</p>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
				Jazz music has a rich, multicultural history with its roots firmly planted in American culture and is considered by many to be a true American art form.   Because of the rising diversity level in schools, it is essential to support a strong, multicultural learning experience through music education, particularly jazz education, to expose students to a variety of musical cultures.  Studying improvisational skills while learning to play both within a large jazz ensemble and a small combo not only challenges a student’s creative thinking, but encourages the growth of significant life skills.  Large jazz ensembles consist of individual musical parts that rarely duplicate throughout each instrumental section, therefore students learn that self-discipline, individual responsibility, and teamwork are essential to creating a beautiful sound. The theory and creativity of jazz improvisation improves listening skills, intonation, and the player’s rhythmic sense, but most importantly, encourages self-discovery and builds self-esteem.  There is much to be gained from a well-rounded education, and the significance of jazz within the music curriculum from a multicultural, historical, and creative perspective is too large to dismiss.
